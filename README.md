# Identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs

# 1). Abstract
The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIM)’s collected dataset con- taining Chest X rays and corresponding labels with bounding box information could help identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, we’ll categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typ- ical, indeterminate, or atypical for CO ̈VID-19. You and your model will work with imaging data and annotations from a group of radiologists.
# 2). Introduction
Five times more deadly than the flu, COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Like other pneumonias, pulmonary infection with COVID-19 results in inflammation and fluid in the lungs. COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias on chest radiographs, which makes it difficult to diagnose. our computer vision model to detect and localize COVID-19 would help doctors provide a quick and confident diagnosis. As a result, patients could get the right treatment before the most severe effects of the virus take hold.
# 3). Problem Statement
Currently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or chest radiograph. However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. In addition, non-radiologists could be supported with better localization of the disease, such as with a visual bounding box. we’ll identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, we’ll categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. This will also enable doctors to see the extent of the disease and help them make decisions regarding treatment. Depending upon severity, affected patients may need hofpitalisation, admission into an intensive care unit, or supportive therapies like mechanical ventilation. As a result of better diagnosis, more patients will quickly receive the best care for their condition, which could mitigate the most severe effects of the virus.
